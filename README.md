# godot-enchanced-tile-map-editor

Hello everyone Godot users! I'm developing an alternative tile editor for the Godot engine v3.5+ that allow:
- Rectangular selection, continuous selection, combination of selections.
- Integrated powerful tile palette
- Drawing with patterns
- Undo-Redo support
- Saving patterns to the bottom panel, tileset metadata (not yet), or copying to plain text
- 3 auto-tilers: Classic, Improved and Terrain (their algorithms are implemented, but not integrated yet)

It is a very early alpha version. I will be glad to your wishes and suggestions for its improvement!
